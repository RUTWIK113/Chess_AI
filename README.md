## üõ†Ô∏è Settings

### üîÅ Human vs Human

Play with a friend by editing `main.py`:

```python
SET_WHITE_AS_BOT = False
SET_BLACK_AS_BOT = False
```

Optional: Flip board in `engine.py`:

```python
self.playerWantsToPlayAsBlack = False
```

### ü§ñ Human vs AI

Play as white vs AI (black):

```python
SET_WHITE_AS_BOT = False
SET_BLACK_AS_BOT = True
```

Or vice versa ‚Äî just flip the booleans.

### üßÆ AI Difficulty (DEPTH)

In `chessAi.py`, change the line:

```python
DEPTH = 3
```

> üîß Higher depth = stronger AI but slower response. 3‚Äì4 is a good balance.

In chess, the en passant rule allows a pawn to capture an opponent's pawn that has moved two squares forward from its starting position. The capturing pawn moves to the square immediately beyond the captured pawn. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Position:**:

2. **Opponent's Move:**

3. **En Passant Capture:**

## Pawn Promotion:

In chess, pawn promotion occurs when a pawn reaches the eighth rank. The pawn can be promoted to any other chess piece (except a king). Here's how it works:

1. **Reach the Eighth Rank**:

2. **Select the Promotion Piece**:
